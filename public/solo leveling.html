<h1>How Solo Leveling Made Me Take Control of My Life</h1>
<hr />
<p>Before Solo Leveling, I was stuck in a quiet war; not with monsters, but with timidity, laziness, self-doubt and a deep-seated anger I didn’t fully understand. Truth is… I was lazy, even though I didn’t want to be.</p>

<p>As a child, I used to be energetic, always on the move. But that energy became a curse, it meant my parents kept sending me on errands while leaving my three brothers, especially my immediate younger one, to relax. It made me feel <b>used</b>. Angry. Like I didn’t have a life of my own. Over time, I began slacking off just to protect my peace. Eventually, laziness became part of me. Now as I’ve grown, I find myself without the energy to even help myself. But I didn’t want to stay this way.</p>

<br />And then came Solo Leveling.

<p>Watching Sung Jin-Woo rise from the weakest hunter to the most feared S-rank didn’t feel fictional; it felt like a mirror. He was weak too. Forgotten. But he didn’t wait to be chosen. He chose himself. He suffered, trained, evolved and became powerful. That hit me hard. It made me realize: I can do this too.</p>


<h2>Level 1: Rebuilding the Body</h2>

I decided to fight back against the laziness and weakness I’d accepted. I challenged myself with:
<br />100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, and a 10km run every day.

<p>At first? I was in pain. I could barely run 4km without slowing down. My muscles burned. I wanted to quit. But I’d think of Jin-Woo in the dungeon; bloody, broken, alone… and still pushing.</p>

Now, I can confidently jog 11km, sometimes at a 5-minute pace, and even dipping into 4 minutes and some seconds. I feel alive. Focused. Stronger.


<h2>Level 2: Rewiring the Mind</h2>

<p>Before, I couldn’t even approach strangers. My voice would mute itself out of fear. I was timid, afraid of confrontation, unsure of my worth. But with every drop of sweat, my mind got sharper. I began taking confidence challenges. I pushed myself to talk to people, even when it scared me.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, I had a great conversation with someone. Today, I froze. But that’s okay. Growth isn’t a straight line. I’m no longer hiding. I’m learning to lead.</p>

<h2>Level 3: From Selfish to Selfless</h2>

<p>I used to dislike my family. The constant chaos, the noise, the pressure. I felt misunderstood. But watching how Jin-Woo cared for his family, how they were his reason to fight, something shifted.</p>

<p>I stopped seeing errands as punishment and began seeing them as responsibilities. I was selfish, always angry at being the one tasked with things. But now, I’m learning to be selfless — without losing myself. I protect my peace, but I show up when it matters.</p>

<br />That’s growth.

<h2>Level 4: Becoming Dangerous </h2>

<p>Now, when I look at myself, I don’t just see someone who works out. I see someone becoming dangerous in the right way; not violent, but disciplined, capable, respected. I’m not just chasing muscles; I’m chasing grit, wealth, freedom, and purpose.</p>

<p>I’m building skills like Python programming, Web3, and 3D modeling. I’m training for a 20km race, even doing sand runs to toughen myself. I’m working on every aspect; spiritually, mentally, financially.</p>

<p>And most importantly? I’m not doing any of it to impress anyone. I’m doing it for me; for the man I know I <del>was meant to</del> will become.</p>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>

<p>Solo Leveling didn’t just inspire me; it gave me a new way of looking at life. I stopped waiting to be chosen. I chose myself. And now, every day, I wake up and press <b>“Start Quest”</b> again.</p>

<br />Because this is no longer a story about weakness.

<br />This is a story about becoming unstoppable.
