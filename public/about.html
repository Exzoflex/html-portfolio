  Hello, and welcome. My name is Erekholome Ikwenwosa Excel but you can call me
  Exzo. I’m a student of Mechanical Engineering with a deep passion for
  learning, building, and improving;not just in academics, but in every aspect
  of life.I am currently undergoing my Students Industrial Work Experience
  Scheme (SIWES) training at a mechanical engineering company, where I’m
  blending theory with practical exposure.Every bolt I tighten, every system I
  observe, every problem I solve contributes to a clearer understanding of how
  things work and how I can make them better. This hands-on experience is
  shaping my mindset, sharpening my skills, and preparing me for a future where
  innovation meets purpose.
</p>

<p>
  My life is guided by a burning desire to become someone unrecognizable that is
  in the best way possible. I am on a mission to transform myself spiritually,
  mentally, academically, financially, emotionally, socially, and physically.
  This isn’t just about self-help; it’s about becoming someone capable of
  lifting others, solving real-world problems, and making a generational impact.
  My daily routine is a blend of learning, discipline, reflection, and
  experimentation; from early morning runs and evening study sessions to
  spiritual renewal and meaningful conversations with strangers as part of my
  100-day confidence challenge.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of my core studies, I am building a skill set that I believe will
  shape the future. I’m diving deep into Python programming, 3D modeling, and
  Web3 development; not because they are trendy, but because they are powerful
  tools for engineering, creativity, and global relevance. I envision a future
  where I create solutions that aid mechanical diagnostics, automate tasks, or
  bridge gaps between people and technology. These tools are not just for career
  development, but for creating systems that empower communities and free up
  time for what truly matters.
</p>

<p>
  I'm also deeply connected to purpose and expression. I am currently writing a
  book titled <b>"Pride is Expensive to Maintain"</b> — a raw and reflective
  work aimed at helping people recognize the hidden costs of ego, fear, and
  comparison. I believe stories shape us, and I want mine to be one of
  transformation, resilience, and wisdom. I want to create content that touches
  lives both online and offline and develop a brand around authenticity, growth,
  and leadership. I aim to be respected for my values, feared for my
  determination, admired for my discipline, and known for my freedom and
  generosity.
</p>

<p>
  My ultimate goal is freedom, not just financial, but mental, emotional, and
  spiritual freedom. I want to live a life where I’m in full control of my time,
  energy, and choices. I dream of building a business where people work with me,
  not just for me and where my online income continues to grow even while I
  sleep. I want to help the poor, mentor the young, and use my voice to inspire
  greatness. Whether it's through engineering, writing, tech, or personal
  development, I am committed to the long road of becoming a man of value to
  myself, to my generation, and to God.
